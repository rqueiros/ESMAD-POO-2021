# ESMAD-POO-2021

## Introduction

This repo will be used to store all the exercise sheets from the Object-Oriented Programming course of the Web Technologies Degree from the Media Arts and Design School of the Polytechnic of Porto.

## Use

Professors will store an exercise sheet to be solved on a weekly basis.
Students should use Visual Studio code and the Web languages (HTML+CSS+JS) to solve the exercises. 

## learnJS tool

As an alternative (or a complement) students can opt by using the learnJS tool (https://rqueiros.github.io/learnjs/). The main benefits of using learnJS is to be able to solve the exercises and have automatic feedback on the success of the resolution. The tool is in Beta stage, so any issue that you find please report to Ricardo Queirós (ricardoqueiros@esmad.ipp.pt).

Good Work!
