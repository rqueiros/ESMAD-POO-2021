## learnJS tool

As an alternative (or a complement) students can opt by using the learnJS tool (https://rqueiros.github.io/learnjs/). The main benefits of using learnJS is to be able to solve the exercises and have automatic feedback on the success of the resolution. Be aware that the tool is in beta stage, so any issue found please report to Ricardo Queirós.

Good Work!
